# 🏦 Loan Prediction System

A machine learning-powered API that predicts loan approval based on applicant data. Built using **FastAPI**, **XGBoost**, and **scikit-learn**, this project demonstrates end-to-end deployment of a predictive model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- FastAPI-based RESTful API for loan prediction
- XGBoost model trained on structured applicant data
- Scaler normalization for consistent input handling
- Modular codebase with preprocessing and training scripts
- Postman support for API testing
